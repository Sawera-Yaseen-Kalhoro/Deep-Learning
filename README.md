# Deep-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of many different types of Deep learning models such as FCNNs, CNNs, RCNNs, Metric Embeddings.

__Lab0__

This folder contains the implementation of binary and multinomial logistic regression.

## **Lab1 (H2)**
This folder contains the implementation of Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) using numpy and followed by using Pytorch. SVM is also implemented using scikit-learn library to compare the results.The models are implemented on the MNIST dataset.

Lab2
This folder contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code is implemented using Pytorch on MNIST and CIFAR datasets.

Lab3
This folder contains the implementation of RNNs. It includes sentiment analysis for Stanford dataset using RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs. Additionally, This folder alao contains the implemetation of Bahdanau attention for sequence classification.

Lab4
This folder includes implementation of metric embedding for classification of MNIST dataset.
